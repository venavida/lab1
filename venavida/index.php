	Hi, I am Vincenzo Roberto E. Navida but you can call me Vince. I am 21 years old and I live in Paranaque City. My hobbies include making music, playing sports and video games, and drinking with friends.
<br>
<br>
Something that you might find surprising or interesting about me is that music is my first love. I taught myself how to play the guitar and the piano when I was 11 by watching Youtube videos. I was once active on Soundcloud and used to do gigs back home in Quezon City. I graduated Highschool in 2014, which probably makes me the oldest person in my class. I'm not delayed because I flunked subjects at my previous school, but because I had to stop for 2 years because of personal reasons. I tend to be seen as an introvert but once I'm comfortable being around a person, I become more lively and show a different side of me. Lastly, I love and value all of my friends; especially the real ones.
<br>
<br>

Right now I feel okay and not okay at the same time, if that makes any sense. Like a normal person I feel good when good things happen to me, and bad when bad things happen. I guess I haven't been the same ever since my Dad passed away, I've become a bit gloomy.

I expect that this class will be fun, because Ms. Jen seems like a fun person. I also believe that this class will be productive because it's our first day and we're already learning new things. As someone who uses a lot of apps, I have certain preferences when it comes to GUI's and designs so I hope to learn the fundamentals in making them.
